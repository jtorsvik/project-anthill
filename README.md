# Project Anthill :ant:

## Introduction

This is a self-developed project by me (@jtorsvik :monkey_face:) for building a Analytics Platform in AWS with the IaC-tool Terraform :heavy_multiplication_x:.

The name Anthill reflects the project's core philosophy: like an anthill, this platform is designed to be highly organized, resilient, and efficient, with each component working autonomously yet harmoniously to support the whole system.

This project aims to:

:mountain_cableway: Automate infrastructure provisioning using Terraform.\
:cloud: Leverage AWS services for data ingestion, storage, processing, and visualization.\
:bar_chart: Enable scalable and maintainable analytics workflows.\
:repeat: Promote modularity, reusability, and CI/CD best practices.\

Whether you're exploring cloud analytics, learning Terraform, or building your own data platform, this project is a hands-on example of how to bring it all together.

The project will also explore the implementation of CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions :arrows_clockwise: and Python Package management with UV :crown:.
